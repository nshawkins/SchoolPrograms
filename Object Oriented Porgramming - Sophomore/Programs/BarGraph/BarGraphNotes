check for '0'
user inputs: print("_____")
              int num1 = scanner.nextInt();
must loop
array size 40

for loop:
i = 0 ..... num - 1
num = 40
for (int i = 0; i < num; i++){
  items[i] = sc.nextInt();
}

height for graph is max value
h being max, use h = x and use if x is <= h: print #
it is based off of an index (x)
