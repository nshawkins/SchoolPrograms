need one array to store the inputs
count used as placeholder for not copying number
the second array checks for the same Number
third array needs to match the count of each number

for (int i = 0; i < count; i++)
  for (int j = 0; i < third array length; j++)
    if (second array[i] == third array[i])
      third array[i]++
