standard run means run and wait
& = run dont wait

dont make seperate programs for the exit, bg, wait

exit means exit the program without considering child processes

bg prints out process IDs

wait waits until all background/child processes finish
    call wait each time a child is born 
    if you get back a child number that isnt in a list of child numbers then throw an error to the ERROR OUTPUT STREAM
        Make it as infomative as possible (not tested systematically)


Working with Parse.c
    command cmd 
    char *line
    char buffer[1000]
    int returnCode = parse(line, &cmd) // 0 is good, -num is bad (probably syntax error)
    if(rc = 0){
        you can use cmd

        //if input is ls *.txt > out.txt
        cmd.argv[0]
        strcmp(cmd.output, "out.txt") == 0
        string str = cmd.output
        // cmd.input works also

        //if input is & sort > out.txt < in.txt
        cmd.bg == 1 //because of &
    }

bg-
    bg should clear after wait
    
    shell> &ls > dir1.txt
    shell> & ls > dir2.txt
    shell> & echo hi mom > hi.txt
    shell> bg
    [idnum1] [idnum2] [idnum3]
    shell>

    //to test bg:
    $ shell < cmds.txt

    cmds.txt:
    ------------
    &ls > dir1.txt
    & ls > dir2.txt
    & echo hi mom > hi.txt
    bg

wait waits for EVERY child process to be done before printing shell>

shell needs to end at end of input also

call fork then exec
    fork makes a new process
    exec changes the new process into the new program

for ui redirection
fork->file operations-> exec *******

& ls > dir1.txt
command.bg = 1
command.argc = 1 //one command that ls sees (name of itself)
command.argv[0] = "ls"
command.argv[1] = ??? //only one thing in the array
command.input = NULL
command.output = "dir.txt"

MUST CLOSE INPUT AND OUTPUT FILES
    close()
    1 is num of stdout
        close number 1 file (second file)
    open()
        returns num of file that got opened
            if -num then it cant open
            else its 0 1 2...

PRINT zombie! if there is a process running in the background and you try to exit
