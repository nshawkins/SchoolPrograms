divide number by every number before it
if the divisor is 0 then it is not prime, excluding 1 (causes a 0)
use an array list
relatively prime is no common divisor

use a function foir finding the prime
function must be the closed formula

7 = 7((1-(1/7)))    1(7*1)/7 - 1/7 = (7-1)/7

9 = 9(1-(1/3)) = 9((3-1)/3) = 18/3 = 6
